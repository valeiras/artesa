# Artesa:

Next app designed for product traceability.

# TODO:

- Use drizzle to manage the database structure -> enforce a coherent naming convention
- Use pagination to lighten the request to the database.
- Add "updated_at" column and order records by this field
- Add a multiple selector to the data table
- Add info on hover
- Improve the recipe update mechanism: avoid de deletion and posterior creation of the whole recipe
- Remove the selected ingredients from the ingredients list
