# TODO:

- Use drizzle to manage the database structure
- Use paginatio to lighten the request to the database.
- Add "updated_at" column and order records by this field
- Add a multiple selector to the data table
- Add info on hover
- Add try/catch to server actions - partially done for the product actions
- Add try/catch for the supabase utils
- Remove implicit any[] from the database responses
